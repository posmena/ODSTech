<p>Affiliate Marketing is a truly unique form of online marketing where the focus truly is in providing you with sales. Affiliate marketing is often over looked as a key part of advertisers (merchants) online marketing strategy and as a results it has remained something of an “anomaly” to marketing teams the world over.</p> 
<p>With the UK Affiliate Marketing Industry now turning over more than £72.6 million in 2009 which accounts for about 10% off all online retail spend the affiliate industry is becoming harder and harder to ignore, which is why companies like Sainsbury’s, My Travel, Virgin to name a few are turning to affiliates as a way of increasing their online market share and it is easy to see why.</p> 
<p><strong><span style="color: #82bcef;">How Affiliate Marketing Works:</span></strong> Affiliate marketing truly performance marketing in its purest form where the merchant (advertiser) is only paying the affiliate (publisher) where they refer a sale to the merchant’s website and that sales has been confirmed. Think of it like having you own sales team who work on a commission only basis.</p> 
<p><strong><span style="color: #82bcef;">The Problem with Affiliate Marketing:</span></strong> getting the most out of your affiliate programme isn’t always as simple as it would appear on the surface. There are literally thousands of affiliates who all work in different ways and use different mediums from SEO, price comparison and review affiliates to PPC, Voucher Codes and email affiliates all of whom will require different information, resources and marketing materials to promote your products and services.
