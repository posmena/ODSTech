<p>Having a product feed enables you to distribute your product catalog to other websites and should be an essential part of your online strategy.</p> 
<p>Your product feed can be used in a number ways:</p> 
<p>1) Distributed to price comparison sites such as Kelkoo, Shopping.com and Pricerunner.  These sites ususally charge a small amount per click ( CPC ) each time they refer a visitor to your site.</p> 
<p>2) Distributed to sites that use the product data to promote your products through an affiliate programme. ( See our affiliate marketing section for more information )</p> 
<p>3) Used to create sitemaps and google base feed.  These are important for Search Engine Optimisation ( SEO ) as the search engine use these sitemaps to help index your products.  A google base listing is free and enables your products to be shown at the top of the search results with a link directly to your product page.</p> 
<p>4) Create an Amazon and Ebay Stores. Listing your products in the Amazon Marketplace is a great way to increase sales. Listing is free and Amazon just take a commission on any sale made.  They handle the payment and you just fulfill the order.  An ebay store is similar, your products are listed on Ebay and they charge a small listing fee and a commission on the sale.</p>
