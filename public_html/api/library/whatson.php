<h3>Black History Month - Surviving conflict, an exhibition by Joy Richardson </h3>
<p><strong>Monday 1 October - Wednesday 31 October, during library opening hours</strong><br>
In these series of oil paintings and drawings, themes of isolation and being part of a community are explored. People engage with the daily rituals of life, but the context in which these rituals are performed have a deep impact on a feeling of safety and finding a place in the world. The adults and children in the paintings often shy away from the viewer, denying eye contact or returning our gaze.<br>
